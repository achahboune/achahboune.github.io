Generate a high-resolution, professional hero image (aspect ratio 16:9 or similar, suitable for a full-width website section) to replace the current broken satellite image on the website.
The new image will be placed directly opposite/across from the following value proposition text block:
"Cold chain intelligence, secured by space.
Real-time IoT monitoring & traceability: Track temperature, humidity, vibration, and CO₂ across the entire supply chain (warehouses, trucks, containers).
Immediate alerts: Automatic detection of excursions/deviations with instant notifications to prevent loss.
Blockchain-proof data: Timestamped, sealed, tamper-proof records ready for audits and disputes.
Automated payments: Smart contracts trigger insurance claims and SLA penalties automatically based on sensor evidence."
Image concept and requirements:
Create a futuristic, high-tech visual that powerfully illustrates the core idea of "cold chain intelligence secured by space." Combine elements of space/satellite technology with real-time cold chain monitoring in a sleek, modern composition. Key visual elements to include:

A prominent Earth view from space with orbiting satellites beaming data signals downward.
Overlay or integrated holographic/digital interfaces showing live sensor data streams (graphs for temperature, humidity, vibration, CO₂).
Visual representations of the supply chain: refrigerated containers on ships, trucks on roads, and warehouses, connected by glowing data lines or beams from the satellites.
Subtle blockchain icons (e.g., chain links, secure locks) and alert notifications integrated into the data flow.
Cool color palette dominated by blues, cyans, and whites to evoke cold chain, trust, and technology, with accents of green for positive alerts/safety.
Clean, professional, premium aesthetic – no clutter, high contrast, sharp details, cinematic lighting. Avoid cartoonish styles; aim for photorealistic with futuristic digital overlays.

The final image should feel innovative, secure, and directly tied to space-enabled cold chain monitoring and blockchain automation. Output in high quality (at least 1920x1080) and save as hero-image.jpg or similar for placement in public/assets.
